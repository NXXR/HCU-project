# Project Scope Statement

#### 1. Corridor & Junction Detection
Detecting the Room Layout and Junctions in Corridors, create trajectories through junctions according to target waypoint.

#### 2. End-to-End Driving Model
Training of an End-to-End Driving model to move along unobstructed corridors to a given waypoint.

#### 3. Route Planning
Implement route planning algorithms to navigate mobile robot through complex environments along waypoints.

###### 4. Object Detection
Train neural network to detect static and mobile objects (obstacles) and modify or set waypoints to avoid obstacles.

###### 5. Floor Type Detection
Train neural network to detect changes in surface texture and detect dirt/stains. Mark position of detected surface as target waypoint.
