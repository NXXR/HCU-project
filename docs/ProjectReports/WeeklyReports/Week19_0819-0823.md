- Total params: 37,757,441
- Trainable params: 37,757,441
- Non-trainable params: 0

## Network Training
- First attempt at full image resolution (960x540) took >40h and produced a network too big to load in jupyter notebook (0.9GB)
- Second attempt at greatly reduced resolution (150x84) took 21:53:38 to train

- currently same structure with 200 epochs in training (estimated training time 4.4h)

## Plans for Week 20
- review network structure and refine training
