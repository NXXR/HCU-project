- [Focus of Project](#Focus-of-Project)
- [Plans for Holidays and Week 04](#Plans-for-Holidays-and-Week-04)

## End-to-End Learning of Driving Models
- Read through [End-to-End Learning of Driving Models with Surround-View Cameras and Route Planners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10158)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/EndToEndLearningOfDrivingModels.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/EndToEndLearningOfDrivingModels.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - Datasets probably irrelevant
    - Driving Model Learning Task and Loss function can be applied
    - visual evaluation of driving route more useful than GPS pin stack
    - surround view reduce overall speed prediction (less important for mobile robot)
        - but useful for more precise understanding of surroundings and reaction to moving obstacles

## Taskonomy: Disentangling Task Transfer Learning
- Read through [Taskonomy: Disentangling Task Transfer Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08328)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/Taskonomy.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/Taskonomy.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - possibly easier training of related tasks with less supervision and introducing less bias

## Focus of Project
- Floor Segmentation and Route Planning for mobile robot
- Object detection can be trained separately (or through Taskonomy related training) and results can be transferred to the route planner

- Main focus of the project is path/floor detection, mapping and planning using the surround-view camera and reaction to mobile obstacles approaching from any direction

## Plans for Holidays and Week 04
- Read remaining sources
    - [End-to-End Navigation with Branch Turning Support using Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/End-to-End-Navigation-with-Branch-Turning-Support-Seiya-Carballo/b9db6c16504dd3e37fb4d47f140174ef80e7a04e)
    - [LayoutNet: Reconstructing the 3d Room Layout from a Single RGB Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08999)
- Create first draft of mission statement (survey results)
- Start first practical tests & attempts with floor detection and segmentation
