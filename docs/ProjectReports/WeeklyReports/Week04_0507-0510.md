## LayoutNet: Reconstructing the 3D Room Layout from a Single RGB Image
- Read through [LayoutNet: Reconstructing the 3D Room Layout from a Single RGB Image](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.08999)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/LayoutNet.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/LayoutNet.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - 3D Layout creation relevant for mapping of mobile robots surroundings
    - LayoutNet only reconstructs room layout, still need to handle "smaller" obstacles (i.e. desks, chairs, persons, etc.)

## End-to-End Navigation with Branch Turning Support Using Convolutional Neural Network
- Read through [End-to-End Navigation with Branch Turning Support Using Convolutional Neural Network](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/End-to-End-Navigation-with-Branch-Turning-Support-Seiya-Carballo/b9db6c16504dd3e37fb4d47f140174ef80e7a04e)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/EndToEndNavigation.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/EndToEndNavigation.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - project very similar to ours
        - LiDAR + front camera instead of surround view camera
        - only trajectory following, no reaction to moving obstacles

## Plans for Week 05
1. Create first draft of mission statement (survey results)
2. Start first practical tests & attempts with floor detection and segmentation
3. Read Additional Material (optional)
