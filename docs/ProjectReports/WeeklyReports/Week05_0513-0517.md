## Online Courses as introduction and refresher for machine learning
- [Machine Learning Online Course by Stanford University & coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) started and ~20% done
- [Deep Learning Onramp by MatLab](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/deep-learning-onramp.html) started and ~40% done

## TurtleBot2 Introduction
- preliminary read of the [TurtleBot Tutorials/Documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot/Tutorials/indigo)
    - ~~Stage is a 2D multi-robot simulator~~
    - Gazebo is a 3D environment simulating camera input
        - behaves similar to a 3D editor
        - models are loaded into a 3D environment

## Project Scope
1. Corridor & Junction Detection
    - Detecting the Room Layout and Junctions in Corridors, create trajectories through junctions according to target waypoint.
2. End-to-End Driving Model
    - Training of an End-to-End Driving model to move along unobstructed corridors to a given waypoint.
3. Route Planning
    - Implement route planning algorithms to navigate mobile robot through complex environments along waypoints.
> Optional Goals
> 4. Object Detection
>   - Train neural network to detect static and mobile objects (obstacles) and modify or set waypoints to avoid obstacles.
>
> 5. Floor Type Detection
>   - Train neural network to detect changes in surface texture and detect dirt/stains. Mark position of detected surface as target waypoint.
