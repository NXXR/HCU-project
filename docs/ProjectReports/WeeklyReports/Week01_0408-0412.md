## Preliminary Workstation Setup
- Created [Github Repository](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project)
    - Created [Project Board](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/projects/2) to track tasks and progress
- Created [Toggl](https://toggl.com) Account and Project for time tracking & management
- Installed [Jetbrains Toolbox](https://jetbrains.com/toolbox) & [Pycharm Professional](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) in preparation for programming tasks


## Preliminary Studies
- Read through [ROS Getting Started](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/StartGuide)
- Read first few Chapters of "Learning OpenCV 3" by Kaehler & Bradski ([O'Reilly](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920044765.do))


## Project Ideas
### Setting PoI (Point of Interest) for Drone by Gesture
*i.e. pointing at an object to have the drone move to, hover above, or orbit the object.*
Preliminary Surface Search:
- [Gesture Controlled Drones](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_GestureControlledDrones)

### Robot Clearance Detection
*i.e. detect overhanging obstacles or tunnels, then detect height and calculate whether the mobile robot can fit underneath it*
Preliminary Surface Search:
- [Overhanging Obstacle Detection](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_OverhangingObstacleDetection)
- [Obstacle Size Measurement](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_ObjectSizeMeasurement)
- [Distance and Area Measurement](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_DistanceAreaMeasuring)
- [Camera Based Size Measurement](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_ObstacleSizeMeasurement)

### Floor Type Detection
*i.e. detect type of ground the robot might drive on, detect different surfaces (soft and hard); detect irregularities (dirt/stains) on uniform surfaces.*
Preliminary Surface Search:
- [Image-Based Floor Segmentation](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_ImageBasedFloorSegmentation)
- [Vision-Based Dirt Detection](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_VisionBasedDirtDetection)

### Drone Mapping for mobile Robot Pathfinding
*i.e. use drone to map surfaces to help pathfinding and task planning of mobile robot, possibly together with [Floor Type Detection](#Floor-Type-Detection) to find stains or dirt and create tasks for robot task planning.*
Preliminary Surface Search:
- [UAV-Robot-Collaboration](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_UAV-Robot-Collaboration)
- [Drone Pathfinding for Mobile Robot](http://bit.ly/mzhcu_DronePathfinding)
