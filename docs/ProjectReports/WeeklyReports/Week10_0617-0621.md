- [Current Roadblocks/Issues](#Current-Roadblocks/Issues)
- [Plans for Week 11](#Plans-for-Week-11)

## Tutorial Project: Classifying Movie Reviews
- Dataset configured
    - 50.000 reviews in dataset, reduced to the 10.000 most common words
    - split 50/50 into training and test set (25.000 each)
    - training set split up into 10.000 entries validation set & 15.000 entries training set
- Network Model compiled
    - 2x 16 unit convolutional layers, rectified linear unit (relu) activation (zero negative values)
    - 1x convolutional output layer, sigmoid activation (squash into [0, 1] interval)

## Current Roadblocks/Issues
- Training on Laptop incompatible, tensorflow & anaconda problems with laptop (due to AMD Radeon GFX Card & SSL 
libraries)
- Training on HCU Desktop currently impeded, tensorflow-gpu doesn't recognice proper cuda driver
    - looking into solutions to detect GFX Card properly
    - downgrading to CPU training suboptimal as it is needed for Intersection Detection Network later
- Training on HCU GPU Training Machine not yet tried

## Plans for Week 11
+ Troubleshoot HCU Desktop cuda driver issues to fix GPU assisted training
+ Move training of networks to GPU Training Machine
+ (opt.) troubleshoot Laptop tensorflow issues, possibly enabling CPU training on Laptop for tutorials
