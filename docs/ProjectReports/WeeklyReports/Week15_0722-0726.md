# Weekly Report 15 (07.22. ~ 07.26.)

## Overview
- [Timeplan for IntersectNet](#Timeplan-for-IntersectNet)
- [Regular Dataset](#Regular-Dataset)
- [CG Dataset](#CG-Dataset)

## Timeplan for IntersectNet
- Generate & Prepare Dataset ~2-3 Weeks (Week 16-18) (07.29.~08.16.)
- Train & Fit Network ~2 Weeks (Week 19-20) (08.19.~08.30.)
- Write Report ~1 Week (Week 21) (09.02.~09.06)

## Regular Dataset
- [2D-3D-S Dataset](http://buildingparser.stanford.edu/dataset.html)
    - 1.413 equirectangular Images
- [360-Dataset](https://vcl.iti.gr/360-dataset/)
    - superset/derivative of multiple datasets (including 2D-3D-S)
    - 12.072 scanned and 10.024 CG scenes
- Advantages:
    - big, independent dataset
- Disadvantages:
    - amount of corridor scenes/images unknown
    - sorting for dataset might take too long
    - camera position too high in most images

## CG Dataset
- Python Script to generate random corridors
- Render euqirectangular surround images at random positions in the corridor
- Advantages:
    - needed amount of images can be generated
- Disadvantages:
    - quality of dataset heavily dependent on quality of textures
    - variation in images may be insufficient and is based on variation of textures

## CG Image Generation
- fixed corridors with random centerpiece
- position camera at semi-random location inside corridor and render equirectangular image
