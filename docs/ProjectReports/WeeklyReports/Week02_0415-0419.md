# Weekly Report 02 (04.15. ~ 04.19.)

## Overview
- [Ni9elf-colab](#Ni9elf-colab)
- [End-to-End Learning of Driving Models](#End-to-End-Learning-of-Driving-Models)
- [Refined Project Idea](#Refined-Project-Idea)
- [Plans for Week 03](#Plans-for-Week-03)

## Ni9elf-colab
- Read through the [Ni9elf-colab Documentation](http://jderobot.org/Ni9elf-colab)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/Ni9elf-colab.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/Ni9elf-colab.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - Real time capable Object Detection from RGB-D data useful for object/floor type detection
    - Issues with small objects may not be applicable for mobile robot identifying objects in an enclosed space

## End-to-End Learning of Driving Models
- Read through parts of [End-to-End Learning of Driving Models with Surround-View Cameras and Route Planners](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10158)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/EndToEndLearningOfDrivingModels.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/EndToEndLearningOfDrivingModels.md)
- Relevance for the project:
    - Datasets probably irrelevant
    - Driving Model Learning potentially useful
    - Cited sources may contain useful information

## Refined Project Idea
- Object/Floor Detection and Path Planning for Mobile Robots
    - Floor Type & (Canny) Edge Detection for Environment Mapping
    - Floor Type & Object Detection to find target waypoints for the mobile robot
    - Mobile Robot Driving Model
        - Task Planning and Prioritisation Module
        - Route Planning Module setting waypoints in the virtual environment map and adjusting route for obstacles
        - low-level navigation routine driving to the next/highest priority waypoint

## Plans for Week 03
- Read remaining sources
