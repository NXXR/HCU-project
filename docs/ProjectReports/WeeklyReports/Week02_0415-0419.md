## Ni9elf-colab
- Read through most of the [Ni9elf-colab Documentation](http://jderobot.org/Ni9elf-colab)
    - [Summary in /docs/notes/Ni9elf-colab.md](https://github.com/NXXR/HCU-project/blob/master/docs/notes/Ni9elf-colab.md)

## End-to-End Learning of Driving Models

## Refined Project Idea
- Object and Floor Detection and Path Planning for Mobile Robots
    - Floor Type & (Canny) Edge Detection for Environment Mapping
    - Floor Type & Object Detection to find target waypoints for the mobile robot
    - Mobile Robot Driving Model
        - Task Planning and Prioritisation Module
        - Route Planning Module setting waypoints in the virtual environment map and adjusting route for obstacles
        - low-level navigation routine driving to the next/highest priority waypoint
