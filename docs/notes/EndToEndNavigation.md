##### Introduction
- development of a navigation system based on end-to-end learning
    - follow assigned trajectories (incl. turning at intersections)
- split into 2 tasks:
    - branch detection
    - behavior change to reach different destination

##### End-to-End Navigation Along a Specified Route
- model needs to be able to detect intersections in order to follow a route
